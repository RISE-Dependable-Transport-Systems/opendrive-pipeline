# opendrive-pipeline
A lightweight toolkit for automating OpenDRIVE map generation. Fetches OpenStreetMap data, converts it to .osm and .xodr artifacts, and optionally builds textured CARLA maps. Ideal for CI/CD pipelines, reproducible digital twin environments, and autonomous vehicle simulation workflows.
